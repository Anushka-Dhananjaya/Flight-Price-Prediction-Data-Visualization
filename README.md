# Flight-Price-Prediction-Data-Visualization
Flight Price Prediction project aimed at analyzing and predicting flight prices using a clean dataset from Kaggle. This project leverages Tableau for data visualization to gain insights into various factors influencing flight prices, such as airline, flight duration, number of stops, departure and arrival times, and more. The goal is to provide valuable insights for passengers, booking agencies, and competitor airlines to make informed decisions and optimize pricing strategies.

The project includes a thorough analysis of the dataset, addressing key questions like the most popular destinations, cities with the most outgoing flights, common source-destination pairs, and variations in flight prices based on different parameters. Visualizations are created to represent these insights clearly and effectively, enhancing understanding and decision-making.
